          Providing a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for the overall health of your Finnish Spitz. Be sure to
          feed your dog high-quality dog food, which should include a mix of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins,
          and minerals. Keep in mind that the dietary needs of your Finnish Spitz may change with age and activity
          levels. Avoid overfeeding your dog, as obesity can lead to various health issues.

        <p itemprop="description">
          Finnish Spitz dogs are energetic and require regular exercise to stay healthy and happy. Plan daily walks,
          play sessions, and engaging activities like agility or obedience training to keep them mentally and physically
          fit. Providing mental stimulation is just as important, so consider offering puzzle toys or interactive games
          to challenge their intellect.

        <h2>3. Socialization and Training</h2>
        <p itemprop="description">
          Early socialization and consistent training are crucial for Finnish Spitz dogs. Expose them to different
          people, animals, and environments from a young age to help prevent unwanted behaviors and ensure they grow up
          to be well-rounded, confident dogs. Positive reinforcement and reward-based training methods work best for
          this breed.

        <p itemprop="description">
          Finnish Spitz dogs have a dense double coat that requires weekly brushing to remove loose hair and minimize
          shedding. Pay attention to their ears, teeth, and nails, and clean or trim them as needed. Schedule regular
          veterinary check-ups to monitor their health and detect any potential issues early.
